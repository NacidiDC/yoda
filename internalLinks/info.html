            <p>Yoda is a central character in the Star Wars franchise, known for his wisdom, mastery of the Force, and unique way of speaking. As a Jedi Master, Yoda is highly respected and serves as a mentor and teacher to many key figures within the Jedi Order. He is characterized by his small, green appearance and his immense strength in the Force, often providing guidance and leadership during crucial moments in the series.</p>

            <p>Throughout the Star Wars saga, Yoda plays pivotal roles in both the prequel and original trilogies. In the prequels, he is a member of the Jedi High Council and works tirelessly to maintain peace and order in the galaxy amid the rising threat of the Sith. Yoda is also deeply involved in training young Jedi, including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Despite his efforts, he witnesses the fall of the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire, leading him to go into exile.</p>
            
            <p>In the original trilogy, Yoda is introduced as a reclusive and enigmatic figure living on the planet Dagobah. He trains Luke Skywalker, the series' protagonist, imparting essential teachings about the Force and the importance of inner strength and wisdom. Yoda's death in "Return of the Jedi" marks the end of an era, but his legacy continues to influence the characters and events within the Star Wars universe. His teachings and example play a crucial role in Luke's development as a Jedi and the eventual restoration of balance to the Force.</p>
